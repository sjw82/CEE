            <p>The Center for Empathy Education (CEE) is a consulting firm which provides resources,
                workshops, and counseling to assist parents, educators, medical professionals, and
                employers in implementing and teaching empathy across multiple vectors, from daily
                interactions to policy decisions. Our services vary greatly based on individual
                needs, but our core focus is working towards equity and compassion through empathy
                in every setting. Our aim is to affirm a culture of inclusion and to inspire
                productive dialogue by bringing empathy into the lives of as many individuals as
                possible with the science of social emotional learning.</p>
